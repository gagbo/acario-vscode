# Acario theme

This is my personal theme. I started with some golden state warriors
related colors and explored from there.

Note that this palette is different from the Acario theme I built on emacs and
published under [Doom Emacs themes](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes).

## Inspiration

The main reason for the palette change is having discovered the high contrast
themes Protesilaos did for [Modus themes](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes)

As the initial inspiration though, I aimed for a cold dark theme, with somewhat
vibrant foreground accent colors. A lot of the colors are inspired, at least in
hue, from NBA teams I like. It's arbitrary but I had to start somewhere.

## Screenshots

Later. (When v1 is published probably)

## Light theme

Even later.
